# ESP8266 Projects
____

_Note_ all the current ESP8266 projects use Thinger.io as an IoT platform. Thinger was chosen because of their "2 free devices per user" policy which allows for long-term maintenance without any cost. Also, among the free-to-use ones, it was the most intuitive and elegant in implementation.
For this reason, the first chapter of this page will be dedicated to thinger connection

## Thinger IO

Thinger.io is a platform which allows for communication between IoT devices through the web and the REST API. It provides a very robust and easy-to-implement API.

### Setting up a Thinger.io account

Go to [thinger.io](http://thinger.io/) and click on "Sign up". Fill in all the fields and choose the free membership. Confirm your email address through the link that will be sent to your inbox.

Once you gain access to the dashboard, select the tab "Devices" on the left, then click "Add Device". Choose a name for the device, we'll use *esp8266* as an example here (remember to choose a different name for each chip you are connecting to the account). Make a note of the "Device Credential" field.
Click on the name on the device to access its configuration page.
On the device page, in the "Device Tokens" box, click on "+ Add".
Give the new token a name, then choose your settings. 
For these projects, my advice is to make non-expiring tokens that control all the resources on the device. This allows for easier software implementation and quicker extension of functionality. Make a note of the token (it's the rsa-looking string on the bottom of the box).

### Setting up the Arduino IDE

Once you have the username and token, it's time to implement functionality in the Arduino IDE. To do this, it's necessary to import the _thinger.io _ library through the Library Manager in the IDE.

For the purpose of these projects it'll be necessary to have installed the esp8266 board. Add a line to your "additional boards manager" in preferences as follows to do this

'http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json'

Then, in the boards manager (Tools > Board > Boards manager), searching "esp8266" will yield the option to install all the necessary files and programs. Depending on your system, you might need to install esptool.

### Interfacing Thinger with the project

'''
#include <ThingerESP8266.h>
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
#include <ESP8266mDNS.h>
#include <WiFiUdp.h>
#include <ArduinoOTA.h>

#define USERNAME "yourUsername"
#define DEVICE_ID "esp8266 (or what you chose before)"
#define DEVICE_CREDENTIAL "The device credential from before"

#define SSID "Your SSID"
#define SSID_PASSWORD "Your Password (I hope it's a WPA2)"

'''

As is evident, we include a number of libraries. All of these came either when the board was installed or when the Thinger library was.
We also need to define some constants that will be used by the MCU to connect to the wifi and to the Thinger.io platform.
