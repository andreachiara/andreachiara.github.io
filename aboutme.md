# About me

My name is Andrea Chiara (the surname is a voluntary omissis), I am a student of Computer Science.
Aki is my nickname (well, one of them). It comes from the bilateral contraction of my name's omophone "andreakiara" in the Italian spelling system or, my name would sound exactly the same with a "k" instead of "ch", so the contraction keeps the "a" for a-ndrea and "ki" for chi-ara.

You can contact me at

Sorry for making you do all this work, but spam's been tough lately.

I was born in 1999, and am currently looking for employment.
I ask you not to contact me for in-situ jobs, as I won't be able to move for the next three to five years due to study reasons and will thus only be available for remote positions.

### Have a wonderful day
