###ESP8266 projects
ESP 8266 is a WiFi/BT enabled MCU (Micro Controller Unit).
All the hereby software for this MCU has been written in the Arduino IDE
with the Arduino programming language (derived from C++).
Programming was attained via esptool.
The projects in this will mostly deal in IoT.

###ESP32 projects
ESP 32 is another WiFi/BT enabled MCU, thought more powerful and with more 
memory than the esp8266 they share a programming toolchain: the Arduino IDE + esptool works great for programming this too.

###FTDI programmer for ESP8266
Electronics project detailing how to build an auto-reset, auto-program board.
This allowa to program the bare esp8266 chip needing only the FTDI board as anotherr component

###Roguelike (C++ game)
C++ roguelike (randomly generated levels in a dungeon), built as a personal challenge.
The code allowed for an in-depth study of input and output manipulation in the command line.
The ncurses library was used.
