### [ESP8266 projects](/esp8266.html)
ESP 8266 is a WiFi/BT enabled MCU (Micro Controller Unit).
All the hereby software for this MCU has been written in the Arduino IDE
with the Arduino programming language (derived from C++).
Programming was attained via esptool.
The projects in this section will mostly deal in IoT.

____

### [ESP32 projects](/esp32.html)
ESP 32 is another WiFi/BT enabled MCU, thought more powerful and with more 
memory than the esp8266 they share a programming toolchain: the Arduino IDE + esptool works great for programming this too.

____

### [FTDI programmer for ESP8266 (images only)](/FTDItoFlash.html)
Electronics project detailing how to build an auto-reset, auto-program board.
This allows to program the bare esp8266 chip needing only the FTDI board as an extra component

____

### [LED matrix display with driver board (coming soon)](/ledmatrix.html)
Electronics project. The goal was to build a LED matrix display from scratch as an exercise in soldering.
The projects includes a driver board built using an off-the-shelf IC (MAX7219).
The official Arduino library for the IC was used.

____

### [Roguelike (C++ game)](https://github.com/cussoandre/roguelike)
C++ roguelike (randomly generated levels in a dungeon), built as a personal challenge.
The code allowed for an in-depth study of input and output manipulation in the command line.
The ncurses library was used.
This post is a direct link to the github repo.
